Once you have ran the program and created your CSV file you should import it with commas as the separator for your columns. Then freeze the first row and sort on column D "Phone Family" and delete the rows with **NOT_PLUGGED_YET** in them. You now have a count by phone type. Please note not all phone types have been added to the program so if you find some please let me know. Thanks.
